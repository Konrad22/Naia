=======================================================
NAIA - PROJECT ETHEA PHASE 1 SHARED LIBRARY - CHANGELOG
=======================================================

Version 20180525+dev:
---------------------
* Lua library:
  * Replaced the AtS implementation of [setup_doors] with its IftU counterpart,
    with minor code improvements and the addition of the AtS requirement for
    target locations to be vacant. Otherwise, the semantics of the AtS
    implementation break IftU S22A and possibly others that require a custom
    SLF.


Version 20180525:
-----------------
* General:
  * Initial version with Wesnoth 1.14 support.
  * Dropped compatibility with Wesnoth versions prior to 1.13.11.
